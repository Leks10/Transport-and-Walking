Thanks to Louis, we found this website: https://data.bikeleague.org/show-your-data/state-data/states-rates-of-active-commuting/

I used this map and the attached file "complete data on communting."  I then isolated the columns just about bike commuting.  Then I created a new csv file, taking out any extraneous data and only leaving the columns of the state names and the data.  I then had to change it from percentages to decimals so it would work in D3 easier.
The final csv file is simply called "Bike_Commuter_Data.csv and it also lives in teh community folder"
