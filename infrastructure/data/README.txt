I deleted two columns from the original data file. The two coloumns are:
- "Percent of Miles of All Rail Trails that are not developed" 
- "U.S. Bicycle Route has been established in the state"
I then renamed the remaining columns with underscore
- Number_of_Rail_Trails (Number of Rail Trails)
- Miles_of_Rail_Trails (Miles of Rail Trails)
- Miles_of_Potential_Rail_Trails (Miles of Potential Rail Trails)
I named the file to use map_data.
