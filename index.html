        <p>Welcome to the MVP of our Group Project website!<p>

        <p>This website is designed to be a dashboard to present relevant information at a glance for different types of users who love biking. You can navigate the website via the bar above ^.<p>

        <p>On our MVP website, we have information relevant for:
            <ul>
                <li>bikers</li>
                <li>bike store owners</li>
                <li>citizens concerned about safety</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>We also have a link to more information about our <a href='our-team/index.html'>team</a>. We are coding novices so we are focused on functionality over form! <p>

        <p>We made this website because we think biking is important. It is a way to stay healthy and protect the environment.<p>
        <p>There are a lot of great resources on the Internet to learn even more about biking, such as <a href='https://bikeleague.org/bfa/ '>The League of American Bicyclists <p>
